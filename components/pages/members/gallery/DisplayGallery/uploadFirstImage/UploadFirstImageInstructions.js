        Fixtura's Media Gallery, where you can upload and manage images that
        represent your club or association. Whether it's photos of players,
        teams, grounds, or clubhouses, your uploads serve as the visual backbone
        for your digital assets.

      <P>
        When Fixtura creates an asset for you, the system intelligently selects
        an image from this galleryâ€”either at random or based on tags you assign.
        This is your opportunity to infuse your club's unique personality into
        every asset
