### Overview

Implement live score updates during game days to show real-time match progress and results.

### Cancellation Reason

Real-time score updates are not part of the current service offering. The application does not process or display live scores during matches.

### What We Need to Do

Integrate with score data sources to display live and final scores for fixtures.

### Phases & Tasks

#### Phase 1: Research and Planning

- [ ] Research available score data sources/APIs
- [ ] Determine data update frequency needs
- [ ] Plan WebSocket vs polling strategy
- [ ] Assess backend requirements

#### Phase 2: Backend Integration

- [ ] Integrate with score data provider
- [ ] Set up real-time data pipeline
- [ ] Create score update endpoints
- [ ] Implement caching strategy

#### Phase 3: Frontend Implementation

- [ ] Add score display to fixture components
- [ ] Implement real-time update mechanism
- [ ] Add live indicator for ongoing matches
- [ ] Style score displays appropriately

#### Phase 4: User Experience

- [ ] Add notifications for score updates
- [ ] Implement auto-refresh toggle
- [ ] Add manual refresh button
- [ ] Show match status (not started, live, finished)

#### Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Test real-time updates
- [ ] Verify performance with multiple live matches
- [ ] Test connection handling and reconnection
- [ ] Check mobile battery/data impact

### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- **Constraints**: Depends on external score data availability
- **Assumptions**: Score data APIs are reliable and affordable
- **Risks**: Real-time updates might increase server load significantly

### Overview

Allow users to export fixtures to calendar applications (iCal format, Google Calendar, Outlook, etc.).

### Cancellation Reason

Export to calendar functionality is not required for the current user workflow and feature set.

- [ ] Generate download functionality

#### Phase 3: Integration Options

- [ ] Add Google Calendar direct integration

- [ ] Create bulk export option for all fixtures
- [ ] Add selective export (filtered fixtures only)

#### Phase 4: User Interface

- [ ] Add export button to UI
- [ ] Design export options modal
- [ ] Add success/error messaging
- [ ] Create help documentation for export feature

#### Phase 5: Testing

- [ ] Test iCal file generation accuracy
- [ ] Verify imports in multiple calendar apps

### Overview

Implement notification system for upcoming fixtures, sending reminders to users before their games.

### Cancellation Reason

Fixture notifications and reminders are not required for the current feature set. Users can view fixtures on-demand through the tracking interface.

### What We Need to Do

Build notification infrastructure to alert users about upcoming fixtures via email, push notifications, or in-app alerts.

### Phases & Tasks

- [ ] Verify notification content accuracy
- [ ] Test unsubscribe functionality
- [ ] Check across multiple devices/browsers

### Constraints, Risks, Assumptions

- **Constraints**: Email delivery depends on third-party services
- **Assumptions**: Users want reminders about their fixtures
- **Risks**: Notification fatigue if too many alerts are sent
- **Risks**: Push notifications require user permission which may be denied
