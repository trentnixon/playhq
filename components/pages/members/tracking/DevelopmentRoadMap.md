_(All current requirements have been completed)_

## üö´ Not Required / Out of Scope

The following items were documented during initial planning but are not required for this feature:

1. **Real-time Score Updates** (TKT-2025-006)

   - Real-time data not part of current service offering

   - Not required for current user workflow

3. **Fixture Notifications** (TKT-2025-008)
   - Not required for current feature set

## üí° Recommendations

- Consider adding loading skeletons instead of simple "Loading..." text for better UX
- The WHY CAN'T I SEE A TEAM section is currently commented out - consider re-enabling as an FAQ accordion
- Add error boundary components to handle API failures gracefully
- Consider pagination or virtual scrolling for organizations with many fixtures
- Add analytics tracking for user interactions (fixture views, tab switches)
- Improve mobile responsiveness for table views
- Add data refresh interval or manual refresh button
- Consider adding team performance graphs/charts
- Implement fixture sharing functionality (social media, links)
- Add comparison view between teams
