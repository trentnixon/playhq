## Background Hooks (Placeholder)

This directory is reserved for future shared hooks used by background variants (e.g., palette-driven gradient resolution, adaptive opacity based on composition segments, or shared timing utilities).

No hooks are currently defined.

### Suggested hooks

- `useBackgroundGradient(variation, palette)` — Derive CSS gradients based on template variation and theme
- `useBackgroundExitTiming(timings)` — Compute start/end frames for exit based on global timings
