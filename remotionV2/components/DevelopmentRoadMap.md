# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Components

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Core component architecture established
- [x] Theme integration via ThemeContext
- [x] Video data integration via VideoDataContext
- [x] Animation system with frame-based rendering
- [x] Background system with multiple variants (Solid, Gradient, Image, Video, Noise, Particles, Patterns)
- [x] Container system with AnimatedContainer and variants
- [x] Typography system with AnimatedText and variants
- [x] Image system with AnimatedImage and rich animation library
- [x] Layout system with screen wrappers and header/title variants
- [x] Transition system with Remotion transition wrappers
- [x] Easing system with shared types and function mapping
- [x] Comprehensive documentation coverage (all folders have readMe.md)

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Performance Optimization**

   - Implement lazy loading for image variants
   - Add memoization for expensive animation calculations
   - Optimize re-renders in animation hooks

2. **Accessibility Improvements**

   - Add ARIA attributes to all interactive components
   - Ensure proper focus management in animated containers
   - Add screen reader support for animated text

3. **Testing Infrastructure**

   - Add unit tests for animation utilities
   - Add integration tests for component composition
   - Add visual regression tests for theme variations

4. **Advanced Animation Features**

   - Add gesture-based animations for touch devices
   - Implement physics-based animations
   - Add animation presets for common use cases

5. **Component Library Expansion**

   - Add more UI primitives to ui/ folder
   - Create compound components for common patterns
   - Add form components for interactive videos

6. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Implement animation frame rate monitoring
   - Add memory usage tracking for large compositions

## üí° Recommendations

- Consider implementing a component registry system for dynamic loading
- Add animation debugging tools for development
- Create a visual component playground for testing variations
- Implement component versioning for backward compatibility
- Add animation performance profiling tools
- Consider adding animation timeline visualization tools

## üìä Documentation Status

- ‚úÖ All main folders have readMe.md files
- ‚úÖ All subfolders have appropriate documentation
- ‚úÖ Cross-references between related components are established
- ‚è≥ Need to add DevelopmentRoadMap.md files to major subfolders
- ‚è≥ Consider adding API documentation for complex components

## üîÑ Recent Updates

- Comprehensive documentation audit completed
- All readMe.md files are up to date with current implementation
- Component relationships and dependencies are well documented
