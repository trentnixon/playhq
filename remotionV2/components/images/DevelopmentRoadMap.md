# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Images

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] AnimatedImage component with comprehensive animation support
- [x] Dual animation system (entry/exit) with frame-based timing
- [x] Aspect ratio and orientation modes (auto/fixed/original)
- [x] Fallback image handling and load/error hooks
- [x] Rich animation library with 14+ animation categories
- [x] Animation categories: fade, zoom, slide, special, rotate, spring, camera, cinematic, effects, perspective/3D, broadcast, composite
- [x] Easing system integration with shared types
- [x] Spring animation support with named configs
- [x] Performance optimizations with memoization
- [x] Comprehensive documentation coverage

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement image lazy loading and preloading
   - Add image caching and optimization
   - Optimize animation calculations for large images
   - Add WebP/AVIF format support with fallbacks

2. **New Animation Types**

   - Add morphing animations between different images
   - Implement AI-powered image animations
   - Add gesture-based image interactions
   - Create custom shader-based image effects

3. **Advanced Features**

   - Add image composition system for layering multiple images
   - Implement image filters and effects (blur, brightness, contrast, etc.)
   - Add image cropping and transformation tools
   - Create image animation timeline controls

4. **Accessibility & SEO**

   - Add comprehensive alt text support
   - Implement image lazy loading with placeholder
   - Add image description for screen readers
   - Ensure proper image sizing and responsive behavior

5. **Testing & Quality**

   - Add unit tests for image animation utilities
   - Implement visual regression tests for image animations
   - Add performance benchmarks for image loading
   - Create image animation debugging tools

6. **Developer Experience**
   - Add interactive image animation playground
   - Create image animation preset library
   - Add image optimization guides
   - Implement image animation timeline visualization

## üí° Recommendations

- Consider implementing image animation composition system
- Add image performance monitoring and profiling
