# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Containers

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] AnimatedContainer component with unified props system
- [x] Comprehensive animation system with entry/exit animations
- [x] Theme integration for colors, sizes, and styles
- [x] Animation types: fade, slide, scale, reveal, spring, 3D, special effects
- [x] Style system for backgrounds, types, sizes, rounding, and shadows
- [x] Animation utilities with easing and spring support
- [x] Pre-wired modules for common animation patterns
- [x] Examples and usage documentation
- [x] Type safety with comprehensive TypeScript definitions

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement animation frame caching
   - Add memoization for expensive style calculations
   - Optimize re-renders in animation hooks
   - Add lazy loading for unused animation modules

2. **New Animation Types**

   - Add morphing animations between different container shapes
   - Implement physics-based animations (bounce, elastic, etc.)
   - Add gesture-based animations for touch devices
   - Create custom shader-based animations

3. **Advanced Features**

   - Add container composition system for nested animations
   - Implement animation timeline controls
   - Add animation event callbacks
   - Create animation preset library

4. **Accessibility Improvements**

   - Add ARIA attributes for animated containers
   - Implement reduced motion support
   - Add focus management for interactive containers
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for all variants

5. **Testing & Quality**

   - Add unit tests for animation utilities
   - Implement visual regression tests
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Create animation debugging tools

6. **Documentation & Developer Experience**
   - Add interactive animation playground
   - Create animation preset documentation
   - Add performance optimization guides
   - Implement animation timeline visualization

## üí° Recommendations

- Consider implementing container animation composition system
- Add animation performance monitoring and profiling
- Create container animation preset library for common use cases
- Implement container animation export/import functionality
- Add animation debugging tools for development

## üìä Documentation Status

- ‚úÖ Main containers readMe.md is comprehensive
- ‚úÖ Animation system is well documented
- ‚úÖ Style system has complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Examples are provided and documented
- ‚úÖ All subfolders have appropriate documentation

## üîÑ Recent Updates

- Animation system unified with comprehensive type safety
- Style system expanded with theme integration
- Pre-wired modules created for common patterns
- Documentation coverage is complete and up to date
