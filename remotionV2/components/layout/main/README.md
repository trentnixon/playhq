## Main Layout

Top-level main layout area composed of reusable header/footer regions.

### Structure

- `header/` — See `./header/README.md`
- `footer/` — Reserved for future footer variants (currently empty)

### Notes

- The main layout regions are referenced by screen wrappers (e.g., `screen/OneColumn.tsx`) using heights from `ThemeContext.layout`.
