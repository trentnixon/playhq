# Cricket Result Single Component Documentation

## Overview

The Cricket Result Single component is designed to display detailed match results for cricket games. It provides a comprehensive view of match data including team scores, player performances, match details, and game status in a visually appealing format.

## Folder Structure

```

```

## How It Works

### Data Flow

1. The `BasicTemplate.tsx` component serves as the entry point
2. It retrieves data from `VideoDataContext`
3. The match result data is converted to strongly typed `MatchResult` objects
4. Data is passed to `ResultSingleDisplay` component which orchestrates rendering
5. Each section (header, teams, stats) is rendered with appropriate animations
6. Multiple match results are rendered as a sequence with transitions

### Data Model

The component works with the following key data structures:

- **MatchResult**: Top-level object containing all match data
- **Team**: Team information including scores, logo, and player performances
- **BattingPerformance**: Individual player batting statistics
- **BowlingPerformance**: Individual player bowling statistics
- **TeamLogo**: Image information for team logos

### Animation System

- The component uses Remotion's animation capabilities
- Key animation constants are defined in `types.tsx`:
  - `RESULT_HEADER_ANIMATION_DURATION`: Controls header animation timing (default: 45 frames)
  - `RESULT_STAGGER_DELAY`: Controls staggered entry timing (default: 15 frames)
  - `RESULT_ANIMATION_DURATION`: Controls general animation duration (default: 30 frames)
- Elements appear in a choreographed sequence with staggered animations
- Transition effects between multiple match results are configured via the `AnimationContext`

### Styling System

- Styling is implemented using CSS-in-JS with responsive design
- Different sections have their own styling modules
- Multiple visual variants are available for key sections such as TeamsSection
- Design follows a modular approach for consistent styling across templates
- Styles automatically adapt to different resolution requirements

## Template System

The result component follows a template pattern where:

1. `BasicTemplate.tsx` serves as the foundational template
2. The `controller/ResultSingleDisplay/display.tsx` handles template selection and rendering
3. Templates are composed of sections (header, team scores, player stats)
4. Various visual styles for each section can be mixed and matched

### Template Variants

The component provides multiple variants for displaying team information:

- **Corners**: Teams displayed in opposite corners
- **Chyron**: Television-style chyron format
- **LowerThird**: Professional broadcast style
- **Layered**: Overlapping layers for visual interest
- **Hexagonal**: Modern hexagonal design elements
- **Modular**: Modular blocks for flexible layouts

### Adding New Templates

To add a new template:

1. Create a new component in the appropriate section directory (e.g., `layout/Sections/TeamsSection/`)
2. Implement the component with proper typing and animations
3. Export the component and add it to the available options in the display controller

Example structure for a new team section template:

```tsx
// layout/Sections/TeamsSection/TeamsSectionNew.tsx
import React from "react";
import { Team } from "../../../types";
import {
  RESULT_ANIMATION_DURATION,
  RESULT_STAGGER_DELAY,
} from "../../../types";

interface Props {
  homeTeam: Team;
  awayTeam: Team;
}

export const TeamsSectionNew: React.FC<Props> = ({ homeTeam, awayTeam }) => {
  return (
    <div
      className="teams-section-new"
      style={{
        animation: `fadeIn ${RESULT_ANIMATION_DURATION}frames ease-in-out`,
        animationDelay: `${RESULT_STAGGER_DELAY}frames`,
      }}
    >
      {/* New template implementation */}
      {/* Home team display */}
      {/* Away team display */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default TeamsSectionNew;
```

## Adding New Components

To add new components or variations:

1. Create a new folder in the appropriate directory:

   - Reusable UI elements → `modules/`
   - Layout structures → `layout/`
   - Data handling → `controller/`

2. Create the component with clear interfaces:

```tsx
// Example of a new component
import React from "react";
import { BattingPerformance } from "../../types";
import { RESULT_ANIMATION_DURATION, RESULT_STAGGER_DELAY } from "../../types";

interface Props {
  performance: BattingPerformance;
  animationDelay: number;
}

export const BattingHighlight: React.FC<Props> = ({
  performance,
  animationDelay,
}) => {
  return (
    <div
      className="batting-highlight"
      style={{
        animationDelay: `${RESULT_STAGGER_DELAY + animationDelay}frames`,
      }}
    >
      {/* Component implementation */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default BattingHighlight;
```

3. Import and use the component in the appropriate template or section

## Potential Improvements

### Short-term Improvements

- Add more visual variations for team sections
- Implement better first/second innings display for multi-innings matches
- Add support for partnership records
- Enhance animations with more diverse effects
- Support for dynamic color schemes based on team colors

### Medium-term Improvements

- Create specialty templates for finals/tournament matches
- Implement historical comparisons for player performances
- Add visual indicators for run rate and target rate
- Support for highlighting match-turning moments
- Integrate with more detailed statistics

### Long-term Enhancements

- 3D elements for premium visual appeal
- Interactive elements for web-based video players
- Dynamic highlights based on match significance
- AI-generated match analysis visualizations
- Integration with live data feeds for real-time updates

## Usage Example

The result component can be used within a Remotion composition as follows:

```tsx
import { Composition } from "remotion";
import { ResultSingle } from "./compositions/cricket/resultSingle";

export const RemotionVideo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Composition
        id="CricketResult"
        component={ResultSingle}
        durationInFrames={300}
        fps={30}
        width={1920}
        height={1080}
      />
    </>
  );
};
```

This documentation will be updated as new features and improvements are added to the result component.
