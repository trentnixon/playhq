## üí° Recommendations

- Split AccountTeam.tsx into separate home/away components for better organization
- Create shared utilities folder for common functions like truncateText
- Implement consistent prop interfaces across all header components
- Add proper TypeScript types for logo configurations
- Consider creating a shared HeaderProps interface
- Fix dynamic Tailwind class generation issues
- Add unit tests for header components (following project pattern of JSON-based testing)

### Current Issues

- Duplicate code between AccountLogoInSubtleWrapper and AccountLogoNoWrapper
- Inconsistent prop interfaces between components
- Hardcoded values for delays and logo sizes
- Missing comprehensive documentation
- Dynamic Tailwind classes may not work properly
