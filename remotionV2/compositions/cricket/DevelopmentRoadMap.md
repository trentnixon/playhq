# Development Roadmap ‚Äì Cricket Compositions

## ‚úÖ Completed

- [x] Core cricket composition architecture established
- [x] Template system with multiple variants (basic, classic, sixersThunder, brickWork, classicTwoColumn)
- [x] Ladder composition with team standings display
- [x] Results composition with multi-screen match results
- [x] Upcoming composition with match previews
- [x] Top 5 composition with player/team rankings
- [x] Result Single composition with detailed match information
- [x] Team Roster composition with player information
- [x] Sponsor Footer composition with branding elements
- [x] Consistent animation system across all compositions
- [x] TypeScript interfaces for cricket data structures
- [x] Comprehensive documentation for each composition type
- [x] Controller-based architecture for logic separation
- [x] Modular component system with reusable parts

## ‚è≥ To Do (easy ‚Üí hard)

1. **Performance Optimizations**

   - Implement lazy loading for large datasets (ladder, results)
   - Add memoization for expensive calculations in controllers
   - Optimize re-renders in animation-heavy compositions
   - Add caching for team logos and images

2. **New Template Variants**

   - Add modern/minimalist template designs
   - Create animated template variants with enhanced motion
   - Implement dark/light theme variants
   - Add seasonal/holiday themed templates

3. **Advanced Features**

   - Add interactive elements for touch devices
   - Implement real-time data updates
   - Add data filtering and sorting options
   - Create composition composition system for complex layouts

4. **Accessibility & SEO**

   - Add comprehensive ARIA support for all compositions
   - Implement reduced motion support for animations
   - Add screen reader descriptions for cricket data
   - Ensure proper contrast ratios for all template variants

5. **Testing & Quality**

   - Add unit tests for composition controllers
   - Implement visual regression tests for all templates
   - Add performance benchmarks for large datasets
   - Create composition debugging tools

6. **Developer Experience**

   - Add interactive composition playground
   - Create template preset library
   - Add composition optimization guides
   - Implement composition timeline visualization

## üí° Recommendations

- Consider implementing composition composition system for layering multiple compositions
- Add composition performance monitoring and profiling
- Create composition preset library for common use cases
- Implement composition export/import functionality for sharing configurations
- Add composition debugging tools for development
- Consider adding composition versioning for backward compatibility

## üìä Documentation Status

- ‚úÖ Main cricket readMe.md is comprehensive
- ‚úÖ All composition types have detailed .md documentation
- ‚úÖ Template system is well documented
- ‚úÖ Animation system has complete documentation
- ‚úÖ Architecture patterns are clearly explained

## üîÑ Recent Updates

- Comprehensive documentation audit completed
- All composition types have detailed documentation
- Template system architecture is well established
- Animation system unified across all compositions
- TypeScript interfaces are comprehensive and type-safe
